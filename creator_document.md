To create an Ansible role that monitors `/usr/local/bin/mount_nas.sh` for changes, triggers a Git repository download, and then runs a specific playbook, you'll need to incorporate a few different components. Here's an outline of the role structure and key tasks:

### Role Structure:

```
roles/
└── monitor_and_update/
    ├── tasks/
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── handlers/
    │   └── main.yml
    └── templates/
        └── file_monitor_script.sh.j2
```

### Tasks (`tasks/main.yml`):

```yaml
---
- name: Check if inotify-tools is installed
  ansible.builtin.package:
    name: inotify-tools
    state: present

- name: Deploy the file monitoring script
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: file_monitor_script.sh.j2
    dest: /usr/local/bin/file_monitor.sh
    mode: '0755'

- name: Ensure the monitoring script is running
  ansible.builtin.command:
    cmd: nohup /usr/local/bin/file_monitor.sh &
  async: 0
  poll: 0
  ignore_errors: true
```

### Handlers (`handlers/main.yml`):

```yaml
---
- name: Download Git repo and run playbook
  ansible.builtin.git:
    repo: 'https://github.com/J-SirL/almalinux9-my-developer-machine'
    dest: '/path/to/repo'
  register: git_result

- name: Run Ansible playbook
  ansible.builtin.command:
    cmd: ansible-playbook /path/to/repo/automate_nas_mount_on_network_change.yml
  when: git_result.changed
```

### Template (`templates/file_monitor_script.sh.j2`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FILE_TO_MONITOR="/usr/local/bin/mount_nas.sh"
REPO_DIR="/path/to/repo"

inotifywait -m -e modify $FILE_TO_MONITOR | while read path action file; do
    if [[ "$file" = "mount_nas.sh" ]]; then
        # Trigger Ansible handler
        ansible localhost -m import_role -a name=monitor_and_update --handlers
    fi
done
```

### Explanation:

- **Tasks**: Set up `inotify-tools`, deploy a monitoring script, and ensure it's running in the background.
- **Handlers**: Define actions to be taken when the file changes – downloading the Git repo and running the playbook.
- **Template**: The monitoring script uses `inotifywait` to watch for changes to the specified file.

### Usage:

1. Include the role in your playbook.
2. Modify the `file_monitor_script.sh.j2` to monitor additional files or change actions as needed.

This role provides a foundational structure. Depending on your specific environment and requirements, you may need to adjust file paths, command syntax, and logic. Be sure to test in a non-production environment first.
