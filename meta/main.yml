    The `file_change_monitor_and_action` role enables robust file monitoring and
    dynamic action execution. Utilizing inotify-tools for file change detection, 
    it automates responses such as cloning Git repositories and running specific 
    Ansible playbooks. This role is ideal for systems where automatic responses 
    to file modifications are critical. It includes a systemd service setup for 
    continuous monitoring and is highly adaptable to various monitoring needs.
